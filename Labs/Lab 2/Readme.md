# Lab 3


## Unpacking
1. Consider the standard date format - `'mm-dd-yyyy'`. Unpack the string into 3 variables `m`, `d` and `y` such that they contain the month, day and year respectively.
2. Use unpacking to swap two variables.

## Fun with loops
1. Consider the matrix stored as list of lists -
```python
l = [[1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]]
```
Write a loop to print the diagonal elements.

2. Print the matrix above in a 3x3 grid -
```python
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
3. 2. Use a for loop to print out 'pams amsp mspa spam' from 'spam'. Try to write the loop in just two lines including the loop header. (Hint: Use slicing to break the string at the desired point)
