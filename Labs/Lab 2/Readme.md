# Lab 2

> For this lab you will need to take input. <br>
> The function `input()` gets input from the user and returns it as a string.

## if-else
1. Write a code to check if a given string begins with  

## Unpacking
1. Consider the standard date format - `'mm-dd-yyyy'`. Unpack the string into 3 variables `m`, `d` and `y` such that they contain the month, day and year respectively.
2. Use unpacking to swap two variables.

## Fun with loops
1. Consider the matrix stored as list of lists -
```python
l = [[1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]]
```
Write a loop to print the diagonal elements.

2. Print the matrix above in a 3x3 grid -
```python
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
3. Use loops and `if-else` to determine if a given string is a palindrome or not. For example - the string `Never odd or even` is a palindrome because it is the same backwards and forwards.
