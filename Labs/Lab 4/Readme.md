As an example to motivate our representation, how would you represent the set of all negative integers? You cannot list them all… one way would be so say: if you give me an integer, I can tell you whether it’s in the set or not: for 3, I say ‘no’; for -1, I say yes.

Mathematically, we call the function which takes an integer as argument and which returns a boolean indicating whether the given integer belongs to a set, the characteristic function of the set. For example, we can characterize the set of negative integers by the characteristic function (x: Int) => x < 0.

Therefore, we choose to represent a set by its characteristic function and define a type alias for this representation:
